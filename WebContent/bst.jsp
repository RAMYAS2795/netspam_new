	i)Burstiness:
		Spammers, usually write their spam reviews in short period of time for two reasons:
		first, because they want to impact readers and other users, 
		second because they are temporal users, they have to write as much as reviews
		they can in short time.                  
							   
		Score=1-( Last Review of item Date - First Review of item Date)/28;

		Threshold value =0.5
			Score > 0.5 => spam
			Score < 0.5  => not spam

		For Ex:
		1 -  [(14/09/17) - (13/ 09/17)]/28;
		1 - (1/28) => 0.96 > 0.5 
		Spam.
